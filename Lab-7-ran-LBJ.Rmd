LBJ's first message in the document

Kermit says hi

"LBJ has changed name to "Github Seaweed Queen""

"lauraing has pivoted into oblivion" <- yes.

If you are the collaborator:
- load the tidyverse
- read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
- make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the Gender column

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```

Question: Is there a significant difference in pretalk ranks of kermit for Male and Female respondents?

```{r}
mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, .)

# Null : There is not a significant difference in ranks for male and female respondents
# Alternative: There is a significant difference in ranks for male and female respondents

mwu_kermit
```

"There was no significant difference in ranks between male and female respondents (W = 155.5, p = 0.4, alpha = 0.05).""

Next question (collaborators): 

Is there a significant change in Kermit rankings before and after his Bren talk?

```{r}

# H0: There is not a significant difference in ranks for pre- and post- talk scores
wsr_kermit <- wilcox.test(kermit$Score.pre, kermit$Score.post, paired = TRUE) # paired = TRUE is how you do a wilcox test with paired data

wsr_kermit

```

There is no significant difference in ranks for pre- and post-talk Kermit scores (statistical summary here...)
